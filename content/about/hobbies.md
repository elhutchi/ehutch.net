I enjoy web design and development, especially when it allows me to create something that I can be proud of. (This site could use some work!)

I love to draw but don't seem to find much time for it. Unfortunately, about the only time I spend drawing these days is when I prepare for [Snow &amp; Sand Sculpting events](/sculptures/). I've also started to like working with modeling clay, which is typically when I make maquettes for our snow sculptures. 

Drawing on a Wacom tablet with GIMP on a computer is also fun. Too bad we don't have undo buttons or layers when drawing with pencil and paper! Pairing this with [GitHub pull requests](https://github.com/elhutchi/sculpture-duck-landing/pull/1/files) makes it an interesting way to use technology to prepare sculpture designs too!

I also enjoy photography. I own a Nikon D80 but haven't used it in ages. Maybe I'll get back to that someday. Well, once I clean the dust speck on the reflex mirror, which I noticed started to show up in my later photos!
